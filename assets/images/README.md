# Images Directory

This directory should contain all image assets for the landing page. You would typically include:

- Hero section background image or video

- About section images
- Testimonial profile photos
- Favicon and logo files

## Recommended Image Formats

- Use WebP with JPEG/PNG fallbacks for better performance
